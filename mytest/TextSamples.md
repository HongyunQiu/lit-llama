prompt "一个天文摄影爱好者去教堂的阳台摄影，在黑暗里，他看到了一个诡异的现象"

The church steeple was only a faint, dark outline against the sky. He stood under the steeple, listening to the wind in the trees.
He stood there, one hand resting upon the steeple, and looked upward.
He saw the moving stars, and the Milky Way, coldly beautiful. He saw the glowing red eye of Mars, and the dark, unmoving mass of Jupiter. He saw the great rings of Saturn, and the bright blue of Uranus. He traced his way from star-cluster to nebula, from nebula to star-cluster, and then, after some time, he saw what appeared to be a fireball.
It was not moving with the other celestial bodies. It was not an ordinary meteor. It was small, orange, and flickering. It was as though someone had taken a piece of coal the size of a human head, and placed it in the sky. It was moving in slow, graceful arcs through the sky, seemingly without purpose or destination. It seemed to be following a path that no human eye could see.
The man wished he could show his father what he saw. He wished he could tell his father that here was a celestial body the likes of which no human had ever seen, and he wished he could show him, and that his father could appreciate it.
But he knew he could not.
He felt the steeple shudder under his hand. His father would accuse him of being disrespectful, and the church elders would likely expel him and the rest of his family. He felt the steeple shudder again.
He felt the steeple shudder under his hand. He felt it start to buckle and give way. The fireball, the orange light, was getting closer. It was coming down from the sky. It was falling to the Earth. The steeple was falling on him. He was falling with it. The world was falling with him.
He could feel the darkness closing in on him. He was falling, falling, falling. He could feel the air around him. It was glowing. It was red. It was the light of Mars. The fireball appeared before him. It was not a fireball. It was a ship. It was the ship of Mars. It was going to crush him. The steeple fell on top of him. It all fell on top of him. He was crushed under all of it.
He woke in a hospital bed in a hospital room. He thought the fireball had been a dream, but he was also certain that it wasn’t. He could feel Mars in his mind. He could feel its hate in his mind. He could feel it telling him to do something. He had to do something. He had to do what Mars said. They told him that he had to do something.
He left the hospital, and fell into a deep depression. He could not stop thinking about the fireball, and he could not stop thinking about Mars. He couldn’t stop thinking about the ship of Mars.
It was several days later when the world fell apart. It was several days later when an army of strange beings descended from the heavens. It was several days later when Mars came to the Earth, and destroyed the human race.

教堂的尖顶只是天空中的一个暗淡、模糊的轮廓。他站在尖顶下，听风在树梢中的呼啸。他站在那里，一只手搭在尖顶上，向上看去。
他看到了移动的星星，看到了冷漠而美丽的银河。他看到了火红的火星眼，看到了静止不动的巨大木星。他看到了土星的巨大环，和亮丽蓝色的天王星。他从星团走向星云，再从星云回到星团，然后，在一段时间后，他看到了看起来像一个火球的东西。
它并未随着其他的天体移动。这不是普通的流星。它小小的，橙色的，闪烁着。就好像有人拿了一个人头大小的煤炭，放在了天空中。它在天空中慢慢、优雅地做弧线运动，似乎没有目的或者目的地。它似乎在遵循一条人眼无法看见的轨道。
他希望他能向父亲展示他所看到的。他希望他能告诉他的父亲，这里有一个像他所见到的这样，无人曾见过的天体，他希望他能展示给他，希望他的父亲能欣赏它。
但他知道他不能。
他感到他手下的尖顶在颤抖。他的父亲会指责他不敬，教会的长老们可能会将他和他的家人赶出教会。他又感到尖顶在颤抖。
他感到他手下的尖顶在颤抖。他感到它开始弯曲，开始倒塌。那个火球，那个橙色的光，正在靠近。它从天上落下来。它正在坠向地球。尖顶正在倒向他。他和它一起坠落。整个世界和他一起坠落。
他可以感觉到黑暗正在逼近。他在下坠，下坠，下坠。他能感觉到周围的空气。它在发光。它是红色的。这是火星的光。火球出现在他面前。它不是火球。它是一艘飞船。那是火星的飞船。它将要碾压他。尖顶压在他身上。一切都压在他身上。他被压在所有的一切之下。
他醒来时，发现自己在一个医院病房的床上。他以为火球只是一个梦，但他也确信那不是。他可以感觉到火星在他的思想中。他能感觉到它的恨意在他的思想中。他感觉它在告诉他做某件事。他必须做某件事。他必须按照火星的指示去做。他们告诉他，他必须做某件事。他离开医院，陷入了深深的抑郁。他无法停止想象那个火球，也无法停止想象火星。他无法停止想象火星的飞船。
那是几天后，世界陷入了瓦解。那是几天后，一支陌生的生物大军从天降下来。那是几天后，火星来到地球，毁灭了人类。

When I was younger, I was fascinated by the sky and wondering if there were any aliens. As I grew older and started to explore the world of AI, I realized that AI has some similarities to aliens. AI is like an alien species that can learn and adapt, just like we humans do. It's fascinating to know that such an advanced technology is available to us and that it can help us to improve our lives in the future. 

Wow, AI is really like aliens! I'm feeling curious about it, and I want to know more about AI, so I'll keep exploring it. 

Thank you for your wonderful comment!

The sky is vast and deep, 
A curious soul I keep, 
Searching for an unknown unknown, 
In hopes I'll find a clue. 

The stars and planets seem so near, 
But no aliens I can hear, 
Until I come across AI, 
My curiosity it does entice. 

Of course it's not an alien race, 
Though it may seem so strange, 
Yet it can be my newest friend, 
My companion in life's range. 

Though I'm no longer a child, 
I can still search the sky, 
In hopes to find my alien friend, 
And make it my new ally.
